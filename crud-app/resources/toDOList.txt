CRUD users

  * Please create the necessary route, controller and blade views to perform CRUD operations on users

  * Assure list of users is paginated

  * Fields to be viewed, created, edited are name and email only. Not doing password changes.


Seeding

  * Update Review seeds and assure they are associated to random and existing users


Auth Specifications

  * Assure the products and users resources require authentication to access

  * Update products and users templates to use the layout that is offered by Breeze.
      * You have some liberty here to customize the layout CSS, IF you have time. Otherwise, just use the defaults from Breeze.

  * Make sure links to routes products.index and users.index are in the navigation

     I should NOT be able to type /create or /edit, /users into the browser and have access to a page that I'm unauthorized for.

Reviews on the product show page
  * Because user's must be auth'd to see products and post a review:
      * Display associated user's name along with the review
      
      
    * A product may have reviews submitted by different users. Log in and out of different users and test this!
